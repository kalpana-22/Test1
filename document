Document file types â€“ DOC and DOCX

The DOC and DOCX file types are a product of Microsoft Word software. 
The Word document originally, as a standard, saved as a DOC document file until the software moved to DOCX extensions.
The DOC file type was popular due to its tie to Microsoft Office but it had its drawbacks. 
The main limitation of the DOC was it was restriction to access only from Microsoft software users. 
This restriction ended with the DOCX document file conversion, which adapts to other word processing sources.

The DOC and DOCX files are versatile and capable of handling tasks for contrasting user types. 
The files contain text but also a wide array of visual elements including graphs and tables. 
The main feature to note when deciding if this file type is right for your selection is the capability for editing it offers.
The standard expectation of any file extension is capability for the original creator to be able to edit it. 
DOC and DOCX go one step further and offer anyone who receives the file the possibility to edit.
